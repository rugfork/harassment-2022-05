i only just woke up so i didnt hack anything yet. now because you have 
threatened me all thats happened is you have threatened to break my 
privacy. no hacking has taken place and none will by me - cant speak for 
anyone else. enjoy the DMCA request to github. ill be keeping an eye on 
your site in the future, if it goes down that would be an awful shame.

*financial loss from UST.  I much sympathize; of course*

no you dont youre a cunt

*But then, you flipped out and flew into a rage at me because I offered 
knowledge to correct some of your basic technical misconceptions about 
Bitcoin. *

what are you talking about i just called you what you are - 
condescending, no rage involved. i am autistic we are blunt. its now 
that im in a rage cunt. basic misconceptions was the problem you assumed 
misconceptions that were not there. you are an old fashioned bitcoin 
maxi. and youre a stuck up cunt. i already knew everything you typed me, 
ive been into computers since the 80s. i actually meant it in a friendly 
jokey way but now we are enemies

*You don’t even know how email works:*

ran my own email server for years. i know *exactly* how it works

*You believe that email is “feeless”.*

i didnt say email was feeless, i said you end up paying through the ISP 
essentially. but you are a stuck up american cop cunt who wants to 
believe what he wants to believe. email is essentially free.

*You apparently don’t know what spam is*

literally everyone knows what spam is, youre just making shit up to try 
and sound superior. youre just a wanker.

*or that Hashcash was a proposed quasi-fee for email. *

dude, nobody cares about your granddad shit. we aint in the DARPA era 
anymore

*Therefore, I think that you are probably just trying to show me up by 
bragging about a wild wannabe-hacker fantasy that you have neither the 
technical skills nor the operational ability to execute*

and its me with the mental health issues ? how would i show you up ? 
what are you even talking about. you are off your fucking face.

again with the condescending shit. you dont know what my level of 
technical expertise is. you dont know anything about me, but you feel 
its your right to invade my privacy and threaten me. well game on cunt.

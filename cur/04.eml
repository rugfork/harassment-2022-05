I spoke too soon.  The Terra forum=E2=80=99s system sent me some ambiguous=
=20
messages that seem to imply that my account must be active.  I sat down=20
to write a long, substantive post=E2=80=94because I want to contribute good=
=20
things for those who deserve it, not to make throwaway posts.  Nope! =20
Still can=E2=80=99t post.

In reply to your earlier message:

>maybe i should switch to PGP im not fond of plaintext either,

There is a relation to Bitcoin.

Hal Finney, who was essentially the co-author of PGP, was also the=20
second Bitcoin user.  Other than mining transactions, the first-ever=20
Bitcoin transaction was Satoshi sending Hal 10 BTC as a test.  Hal=20
actively contributed to Bitcoin, even though he was deathly ill from=20
ALS.  He continued contributing to Bitcoin, even when he was totally=20
paralyzed=E2=80=94he was typing through an eyetracking device, writing code=
 for=20
Bitcoin.  Then, he died.  It is a part of Bitcoin history; I also=20
consider it a part of the legacy of PGP.

Hal Finney desribes his experiences with Bitcoin, about a year before=20
his death:
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3D155054.0

As a Bitcoiner, I know that there are problems in Bitcoinland.  Nothing=20
is perfect.  But there also *idealists* in Bitcoin, who are not=20
motivated by only raw greed.

A bad aspect of this for me personally:  I have Bitcoiner friends who=20
*told* me that Terra was no good, who *told* me not to trust Do Kwon.  I=20
argued with them.  I defended Do Kwon=E2=80=99s reputation to them.  I even=
=20
pushed some of them into buying LUNA in the crash.  I have mentioned=20
this on the Terra forum; dig through some of my posts a few weeks ago. =20
Now I am humiliated, because I believed in Do Kwon and TFL.  I=E2=80=99m th=
e=20
fool.  And I feel that I need to pay my friends back someday, even=20
though of course they don=E2=80=99t expect it.

In Bitcoin, any =E2=80=9Cproposal=E2=80=9D like this rugfork would bring cr=
owds of=20
outraged Bitcoiners doing... pretty much what I=E2=80=99ve been doing.  Cro=
wds=20
of them.  This is not only a theory:  It has happened.  Wealthy,=20
powerful parties have tried to corrupt Bitcoin.  They failed, and they=20
lost money, because the Bitcoin community absolutely would not tolerate=20
it.

Kris, I get what you want.  I want it, too.  A decentralized,=20
permissionless way to have money that=E2=80=99s stable in value.  And when =
I=20
think of how close I came to being in your position myself, I am=20
frightened.  I had a large % of my money in UST.  If it had gone to=20
$0.05 while I had it, I may have wound up insolvent=E2=80=94debts exceeding=
=20
assets=E2=80=94wiped out, kaput, flat broke, all BTC and everything else to=
tally=20
lost.  I see your story, and I see all the other nightmare horror=20
stories, and I think...  That was almost me.

I hope you get your money back.  At least some of it.  Someday. =20
Necessarily, I am rather pessimistic about that.

You said:

>i dont particularly like people nicking my cash

Of course not.  Same here.

I made big sacrifices to buy LUNA at the bottom.  Took risks I could not=20
afford.  Because I believed in this project.  Because I was passionate=20
about it.  I would NOT do such a thing as an =E2=80=9Cinvestment=E2=80=9D=
=E2=80=94I am not so=20
stupid as to take risks I can=E2=80=99t afford, as an investment!  And as t=
hanks=20
for believing in his project, Do Kwon wants to steal my money.

I regret that I may not be able to do much of this long correspondence. =20
I=E2=80=99ve been working on this Terra mess day and night for weeks.  It=
=E2=80=99s not=20
only about the money.  With this much effort, I could make much more=20
money.  Now, back to work...

let me know if i can help not short of time and im handy with tech. im 
familiar with bitcoin stuff, im not so enamored with it really, im a bit 
of a futurist and it seems a bit old hat now. for a start why should 
there be a fee when sending and why use all that power? its all the same 
stuff i thought when it came out tho tbf. thats why i didnt hold doh. 
would be good to have a website which scrapes all sources of TFL info, 
and it would be good to store the evidence of my UST, not sure how in a 
way which can be legally presented.

anyway check you soon. interested to see your next projects.

autistic people do not have 'mental illness' we have a different 
neurological makeup to you, its very clear that you are the one with 
mental health issues putting up private emails on a website after going 
on extensively about how you like to remain private just because i 
called you condescending - which you so clearly are. its only your 
privacy that should be private tho eh ? what an absolute cunt. dont try 
and give me advice you fucking prick.

its clear that you are a condescending wanker! was just about to give 
you a juicy piece of evidence but i discovered this unbelievably 
confrontational mail.  you didnt want mail so im going to be giving this 
one out to basically everyone everywhere lol. have fun. dont fuck with 
hackers!

DAG is still also a feeless network despite your ignorance. you are 
obviously butthurt someone is more technical than you. ive heard all 
your boring bitcoin lectures and history before you think you are 
educating me ?

FUCKOFF!


put this on the internet: hyperion is a stuck up wanker. put the ip 
addresses in as well. see if i give a shit, i dont use real ones. i 
posted that agora is going to go down on their own forum under my real 
name. see if i give a fuck mate. ill be looking to expose your privacy 
now as well, so game on bitch.

another cunt on the internet .

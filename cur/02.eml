are you autistic as well? you seem like you might be. im the chocolate 
bloke that is ranting quite extensively :) i dont particularly like 
people nicking my cash

so what the fuck can be done about this mess, maybe i should switch to 
PGP im not fond of plaintext either, PGP is such a pain in the ass tho. 
got thunderbird n that but ive got so many keys im kind of overloaded

im usually thrown off everywhere because of my blunt style but ive 
remained on this terra forum for quite a while somehow (thats a week in 
my terms). survived a campaign of some dude calling me a paid 
establishment shill, managed to get him mostly deleted. im actually a 
homeless autistic in a caravan in a field in the middle of nowhere. 
mostly in bed cos it hurts to move lol. calling me an establishment 
shill is so far off its pretty funny.

btw looked into that new report earlier quickly, did a very quick whois 
not in depth forensics heh but yeh er one of the 7 big addresses that 
caused the crash is registered to dokwonmsl.eth

https://app.ens.domains/address/0x1Df8eA15bb725E110118f031e8E71b91abaa2A06

https://app.ens.domains/name/hs0327.eth/details < here if you click on 
registrant

this is probably explainable and i would guess dokwon was unwittingly 
part of the attack or whatever you want to call it, i dont know though yet


i would love to see luna classic n ust gain again without him, i would 
like to see a completely different voting service, mods on the site and 
different style of forum. i think really that crypto has to solve this 
problem to be seen by the public as having any credibility at all at 
this stage. anyway im not techie enough to lead but i have good ideas 
and a strong moral compass.

i still have my UST and am wondering wtf to do, there is a conference 
call with some legal firm on monday, dunno whether to join. i would 
rather they refund me really, i bet there arent going to follow through 
with that now.

anyway off i fart, let me know if there is anything i can do to help, i 
can write scripts n shit to do that i assume you can as well :)

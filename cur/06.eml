There is a fee because running the network has costs.  Unavoidable fact=20
of life:  =E2=80=9CThere is no such thing as a free lunch.=E2=80=9D  Withou=
t a fee, it=20
would just mean that someone else is paying all the real costs of your=20
transaction; is that fair?

Why it uses power:  To understand the answer, you need to know some=20
computer science.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault

Satoshi used the power-intensive block generation (=E2=80=9Cmining=E2=80=9D=
) scheme to=20
solve a very hard problem.  How do you pick the order of transactions=20
*without a central authority*, to prevent people from pulling scams=20
where they spend the same money twice?  In technical terms:  This is a=20
distributed database problem requiring Byzantine fault-tolerance. =20
Researchers had been struggling with this problem for decades.  No one=20
ever solved it in a deployable, practical way before Satoshi=E2=80=94before=
=20
Bitcoin.

Please don=E2=80=99t criticize what you don=E2=80=99t understand.

Before Bitcoin, the only way to prevent =E2=80=9Cdouble-spend attacks=E2=80=
=9D was with=20
a central authority.  The central authority can be corrupt like Do Kwon. =
=20
Or it can simply fail.  In the 1990s, there was a cryptographic currency=20
called Digicash.  The Digicash company went bankrupt.  Digicash holders=20
lost their money:  Without the Digicash company, there wasn=E2=80=99t even =
a way=20
to transact Digicash anymore.

Bitcoin does not have these problems.  There is no Do Kwon type of=20
figure who can control the network; some powerful parties have tried to=20
take over Bitcoin like DK just did with the big POS validators, and they=20
failed.  There is no Bitcoin company that could fail and disappear:  As=20
long as someone out there is running free, open-source Bitcoin nodes=E2=80=
=94and=20
as long as someone is mining=E2=80=94you can run your own free, open-source=
=20
Bitcoin node, and transact BTC.  The system is designed for maximal=20
freedom and total decentralization.

Many altcoins promise =E2=80=9Cfuturistic=E2=80=9D advancements over Bitcoi=
n.  Most of=20
those promises are false.  Is Terra the =E2=80=9Cfuture=E2=80=9D?

Happy to explain (but in haste),

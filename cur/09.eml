Please be advised that if I receive any report indicating that you may=20
have executed your expressed illegal intentions, then I will publish a=20
full evidentiary record of our correspondence at this webpage (including=20
relevant email `Received` headers):

https://rugfork.com/v0/2022-05-29_illegal_intentions.html

The substantive text of this email (with your information redacted) is=20
already published there.

I will leave it at that for now.  If *anything* that you told me is=20
true, then you are a homeless individual with admitted mental issues who=20
suffered a catastrophic financial loss from UST.  I much sympathize; of=20
course, you are angry and upset about that!  When a thief steals your=20
money, anger is a natural and normal response.  But then, you flipped=20
out and flew into a rage at me because I offered knowledge to correct=20
some of your basic technical misconceptions about Bitcoin.

That bears on the credibility of your expressed intentions.  You don=E2=80=
=99t=20
even know how email works:  You believe that email is =E2=80=9Cfeeless=E2=
=80=9D.  You=20
apparently don=E2=80=99t know what spam is, or that Hashcash was a proposed=
=20
quasi-fee for email.  Therefore, I think that you are probably just=20
trying to show me up by bragging about a wild wannabe-hacker fantasy=20
that you have neither the technical skills nor the operational ability=20
to execute.  Out of empathy for your plight, I have no desire to get you=20
in trouble for that.

I do think it=E2=80=99s reprehensible that you wish, in effect, to destroy=
=20
evidence that I am working to try to preserve.  That would be a gift to=20
Terra.  Even worse in the abstract, you wish to respond to Do Kwon=E2=80=99=
s=20
crimes with some crimes of your own.  I am not a criminal like Do Kwon. =20
My cause is just.  I will take the high road.

I advise you to seek legal assistance recovering the money that Terra=20
owes to you=E2=80=94and to get some sort of help staying grounded in realit=
y. =20
Also, please work on your ability to manage anger, and to distinguish=20
between appropriate and inappropriate responses to things that make you=20
angry.

Now, I demand that you immediately cease and desist from contacting me. =20
I have no interest in discussions of illegal activity, or in discussions=20
with people who want to discuss illegal activity.  Any further=20
correspondence from you may be published here at my sole discretion,=20
with your identifying information unredacted.

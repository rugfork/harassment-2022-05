Hi, thanks for writing.

In answer to your question, no, I=E2=80=99m not autistic.  Though I know th=
at in=20
tech, many are.

>rather they refund me really, i bet there arent going to follow through=20
>with that now.

I hope that you get repaid.  It looks doubtful, and I don=E2=80=99t want to=
 give=20
you any false hopes.  Your position is difficult; no matter what you do=20
or don=E2=80=99t do, you could get burned worse.  Hold (potentially to zero=
), or=20
take a near-total loss and then potentially lose some sort of unknown=20
future recovery or compensation?  If I had UST, I would probably hold=20
it, wait to see what happens, and fight for compensation; but that=E2=80=99=
s=20
just me, just my way of managing risks and facing adversity.  I=E2=80=99m a=
lso=20
holding LUNA bought so low that I could exit with a *profit* now=E2=80=94an=
d I=20
really need the money; for me to hold now is so crazy, everyone would=20
call me a Lunatic!  Everyone is different, and everyone=E2=80=99s situation=
 is=20
different.

On the bright side, the Terra forum=E2=80=99s robot just notified me that m=
y=20
=E2=80=9Ctrust level=E2=80=9D was increased.  I guess it means that my acco=
unt is=20
un-suspended?  It doesn=E2=80=99t say.  We=E2=80=99ll see!

Catch up with you later,

Hyperion
